# Introduction

In the grand kingdom of Web Development, a new legend is born. Anchoring its roots in the land of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), this epic saga — named project — was initiated with the enchanting spell of [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## The First Steps on Your Journey

Just as a fledgling phoenix learns to fly, your first endeavor is to awaken the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

As the server stirs to life, make your way through the digital ether to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your chosen browser and gaze upon the majesty of creation.

Your next task? Venture into the unknown! Start manipulating the landscape of `app/page.tsx`, and watch as the pages shift and morph in real-time.

Also, never forget the secret weapon bestowed upon this project. It utilizes the magical artifact [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and summon the aid of [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a powerful new font entity bequeathed by Vercel.

## Deploy on the Sacred Grounds of Vercel

The swiftest way to see your Next.js application ascend is to perform the sacred rite at the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme), the birthplace of Next.js itself.
